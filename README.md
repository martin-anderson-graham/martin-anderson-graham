### Hi there, my name is Martin ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer from Waco, Texas. Formerly a teacher and IT Director at a small school, I enjoy solving technical problems in pursuit of a shared organizational mission. I'm comfortable with Node.js, Express, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, PostgreSQL and a collection of AWS Services.

I am most recently one of the creators of [Trellis](https://trellis-deployment.github.io/), an open-source serverless deployment pipeline tool.

I'm currently looking for work, find more at my site [martingraham.dev](martingraham.dev)
