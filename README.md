### Hi there, my name is Martin 👋

I am a software developer from Waco, Texas. Formerly a teacher and IT Director at a small school, I enjoy solving technical problems in pursuit of a shared organizational mission. I'm comfortable with Node.js, Express, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, PostgreSQL and a collection of AWS Services.

I am most recently one of the creators of <a href ='https://trellis-deployment.github.io/' target = "_blank">Trellis</a>, an open-source serverless deployment pipeline tool.

I'm currently looking for work, find more at my site <a href ='https://martingraham.dev/' target = "_blank">martingraham.dev</a>.
