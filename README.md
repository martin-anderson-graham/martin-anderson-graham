### Hi there, my name is Martin ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer from Waco, Texas. Formerly a teacher and IT Director at a small school, I enjoy solving technical problems in pursuit of a shared organizational mission. I'm comfortable with Node.js, React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Python and Django.

I'm currently working as a software developer at [Property Meld](https://www.propertymeld.com). Find out more about me at my site <a href ='https://martingraham.dev/' target = "_blank">martingraham.dev</a>.
