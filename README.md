### Hi there, my name is Martin ðŸ‘‹

Formerly a teacher math and science teacher, a few years ago I transitioned into software engineering. I enjoy solving technical problems in pursuit of a shared organizational mission, but still retain a love of teaching and mentoring younger engineers.

I'm currently working as a software developer at [Property Meld](https://www.propertymeld.com). Find out more about me at my site <a href ='https://martingraham.dev/' target = "_blank">martingraham.dev</a>. My current hobby project is [prediction-ledger](https://github.com/martin-anderson-graham/prediction-ledger), a TUI written in Rust used to track and score the accuracy of your predictions about the world.
